Hey, I'm Sebastian, I'm a Software Engineer at [Envoy](https://www.envoy.com).

I like writting about software. I really hope you find my posts helpful.


Please feel free to reach out to me if there's anything you feel I can help with or in case there's something that can be improved in any of the posts.

## Side Projects

Working on side projects is a great way to learn, I totally encourage you to get something out there, for real or for fun, I guarantee you won't regret it. Here are my side projects:

- [Frozonic](https://frozonic.app): Frozonic is a project for managing code freezing periods on Github repos. The idea is to be able to communicate when a code freeze is active so that teams are aware.

## Consulting

I'm currently open to consulting. I have experience on Ruby on Rails, Backend applications, API development and integrations. Please reach out to me at [sebasjimenezv@gmail.com](mailto:sebasjimenezv@gmail.com).

Best,<br>
Sebastian J.
