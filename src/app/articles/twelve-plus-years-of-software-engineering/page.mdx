# 12+ Years of Software Engineering
### Lessons on change, consistency, and ownership from a decade in tech

Looking back, it does seem crazy how long it's been and how fast time has gone by. I remember the joy of digging into something new and the eagerness to see it cross the line. Back then, time felt abstract—it would accelerate while I was working, and suddenly 10 to 12 hours had gone by just like that.

## Leaving Java, Finding Ruby

I truly didn't understand how much could be accomplished in a short period until I left the Java world and entered the Ruby world. As I got more familiar with concepts like **Convention over Configuration** and **metaprogramming**, I started valuing how framework code could set me up for success—or at least for speed.

It was hard for me to leave a comfort zone once I found one where I felt fluent and efficient. Back in university, I remember it took me a while to replace **BlueJ** (a visual Java editor) with **Eclipse**. Thinking back, it makes sense—I was familiar with it, and I could move fast, so why change, right? But little did I know that change actually sets you up for even more success than staying comfortable.

Why? Because it helps develop the skill of adapting and learning quickly.  
You stop fearing new things—you get excited by them.

## Baptism by Fire

The same thing happened when I moved from Java to Ruby. I wasn't just comfortable with Java—I was wired into it. Naturally, my brain leaned toward what required less energy and effort. But somehow, I made the switch anyway. And I did it the hard way (not on purpose).

I took on a project that was basically coming back from the dead. It needed a full rewrite—from **C# to Ruby**—and a complete database migration from **NoSQL to PostgreSQL**.

I implemented everything from scratch:

- CI/CD pipelines  
- Code coverage metrics  
- Testing infrastructure  
- A full feature rebuild

Honestly, no one in their right mind would've taken this on with practically zero Ruby and Rails experience. But like my manager said at the time:

> **“Your resume sucked, but we needed someone.”**

Lucky for me, it was the best way to get onboarded into the Rails world.

## Creation as Motivation

Fast forward a couple of years, I was flying on Rails (or so I thought). I was designing and implementing APIs, integrating them with front-ends, and building products.

And that right there was the magic word for me: **creating**.

The idea of building something that could serve others and add value was so powerful in my head. I couldn't stop imagining one day launching something of my own—something I could share with the world.

I did take a few stabs at it. But what I didn't know back then was how much **consistency and patience** it really takes.

I probably have 4 - 5 “dead” side projects. I believe they all served a purpose—and who knows, maybe I'll revive one just for fun. But the main lesson that stuck with me was what I had been missing all along: **consistency**.

## The Trap of Running on Steam

There's another part of the entrepreneurial experience that, when combined with lack of consistency, will kill any effort:

> The belief that to be a valuable asset in an organization, you have to be going full steam at all times.

That mindset wears you down and empties your tank. There's a healthier and more sustainable alternative. I call it **ownership**.

When you own something, your effort is focused. Your energy goes where it matters. That clarity gives you room to explore and dabble in other areas you're interested in.

That entrepreneurial spirit is something I feel lucky to have—  
It's what fuels my curiosity and keeps me pushing the edges of what I know.

## Shifting Gears

After spending most of the last decade in the Valley, I want to shift gears into something more diverse, encouraging, and fun.

I want to keep pushing myself out of my comfort zone—trying new languages, frameworks, and tools. Jumping on hype trains that might go nowhere, but always leave lessons behind.

It doesn't make sense to pour yourself into something that drains your life outside of it.  
**It's just not worth it.**

## Final Thoughts

Twelve years in, and I still feel like I'm just getting started. The tools change, the hype cycles spin, but what really matters—the core habits and mindset—stay the same.

If there's one thing I've learned, it's that growth comes from discomfort, not from staying where things are easy. Consistency beats intensity. And ownership—not just of the code, but of your direction—makes the difference between burning out and staying in the game.

The tech world moves fast, but your internal pace matters more. It's not about chasing every trend—it's about choosing what to lean into, why you're doing it, and whether it still feels like yours.

If you're switching stacks, chasing ideas, or just feeling stuck—keep at it. The best progress usually feels a little messy when you're in it.

Keep building. Keep learning. Keep showing up.  
And don't forget to come up for air.
