# 10 Years of Ruby on Rails
### Reflections from a decade in the framework that shaped how I build

It's nuts to think I've been doing Rails for over 10 years. It feels like just yesterday I was struggling to understand the conventions—wrapping my head around the "magic" that came out of the box and quietly worked behind the scenes. It really felt like magic. How could you call a method that wasn't even defined anywhere in the codebase? What do you mean, *metaprogramming*? *Polymorphic relationships*? Wait, what?

There were so many concepts to process—all useful, all foundational. They didn't just help me build things—they helped me understand how things actually work. What Rails gave me wasn't just shortcuts, but a deeper sense of what good engineering looks like. Solutions that worked, and were shared and owned by others.

## The Curiosity Spark

Rails is full of clever, thoughtful ideas. That's what pulled me in. It lit up a curiosity that hasn't left me since. It made me want to learn—not just to code, but to understand. And that's why I'm grateful I found it when I did.

I honestly believe I learned more through Rails than I ever would've on the Java path. Rails threw me into things—fast. And the only way forward was to figure them out. Redis, Sidekiq, background jobs, API integrations, webhooks, SAML, Kafka, cloud services—just to name a few.

## Building With Purpose

What's even more interesting is that the drive to use these tools—to sit down and build—is still there. I still love designing systems that solve real problems. Tools that serve people. Products that make things easier. That add value. That move things forward.

That's what fuels me: the act of building toward a future you can imagine—and maybe even help shape.

## Rails, On Your Terms

Sure, some parts of Rails could be better. A few things feel dated. Others become awkward over time. But here's the thing: most of them are optional.

Rails remains one of the most flexible frameworks I've worked with. You can build your own flavor—versioning endpoints, separating business logic, integrating with external systems—without fighting the framework. I never feel boxed in by the defaults. And when things do get repetitive? We've got tools now to handle the boilerplate.

## Looking Ahead

I'm excited about what's coming. Yes—I want to explore more. New tools. New languages. New ideas. But now, after a decade in Rails, I know what a great developer experience feels like. What thoughtful design looks like. What actually moves the needle on productivity.

And that's something I'll carry with me, wherever I go next.

## Final Thoughts

Rails didn't just teach me how to build applications—it taught me how to think like a builder. It exposed me to ideas I wouldn't have picked up as quickly elsewhere. It challenged me, shaped my habits, and gave me a foundation I still rely on.

Ten years in, and I'm still learning. Still building. Still curious.

And while I'm excited to explore new tools and ecosystems, Rails will always be the place where it clicked for me. The place where things went from abstract to real. From messy to elegant. From code to product.

Whatever comes next, I'll keep carrying that clarity with me.
