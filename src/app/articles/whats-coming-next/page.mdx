## What's Coming Next?

After so many years, I still feel that drive to learn and stay curious. I want to share a few things that have me genuinely excited about what's ahead.

## Languages I Want to Explore

Elixir, Zig, and possibly Rust have been catching my attention more and more. There's something really appealing about their design, their communities, and what they enable. I'm excited to carve out some time to play with them and see where they take me.

## AI and Infrastructure Curiosity

I want to continue exploring how AI can automate workflows in ways that feel almost magical. I'm also interested in understanding more about MCP servers and the engineering behind them. Things are evolving fast, and I want to stay close to that pace.

## A New Chapter at Shopify

I'm happy to share that I've joined Shopify! I'm pumped about the team I'm joining and the challenges ahead. It's always energizing to enter a new environment with smart people building ambitious things.

## Back to Linux and Dev Setup Tweaks

I've been thinking about giving Linux another go—it's been over 12 years since I last used it. A lot has changed, and I'm curious about what the dev experience is like now. I also want to fully transition to a split keyboard and finally get my dev environment dialed in. Tech Twitter and programming influencers definitely played a role in sparking that motivation.

## Reigniting the Entrepreneurial Spark

Entrepreneurship has always been in the picture for me. The full-time roles I've had gave me stability but also made it easy to put that part of me on pause. I'm back to exploring now. If you're working on something cool or want to team up—reach out.

## Final Thoughts

This one's short and casual, but it captures how I'm feeling lately—motivated, curious, and ready for what's next. If you're in a similar place, keep learning, keep tinkering, and keep pushing forward. There's always more ahead than you think.
